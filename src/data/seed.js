// This project has no backend. Instead, both the admin panel and the public
// website read from one localStorage-backed "database" (see mockDb.js), and
// this file is what that database is seeded with the first time it runs.
//
// IMPORTANT: this file is duplicated verbatim in:
//   - frontend/src/data/seed.js
//   - admin-panel/src/data/seed.js
// Edit one, copy to the other. (Kept as copies so each Vite app stays
// self-contained and needs no path aliases or fs.allow config.)
//
// Field names follow Database-Schema.md so this can be swapped for a real
// REST API later with no changes to any page component.
